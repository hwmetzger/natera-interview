# Henry "Hank" Wells Metzger

Greetings! I am submitting this repository as part of the interview process for the [Senior Software Engineer, Front-End Web Development](https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=6c0e9d6e5d465f92&from=apply-conf) role with Natera, Inc. in Austin, Texas.

## Getting Started

Below you will find instructions on how to get the application running. Running both the front-end and the back-end will require two terminal/command windows.

Run the following commands...

### Front-End

    cd front-end
    npm install
    npm run dev

### Back-End

    cd back-end
    npm install
    npm run start

Once both terminals are running open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). This will load a "Login" screen. From there you can select Form 1 or Form 2 to view.
